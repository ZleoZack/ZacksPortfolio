     <hr>
      <p>Hello, I am a 28 year old aspiring Software Egineer.</p>
     <p>I am so excited to embark on this new journey in Software Engineering. Not only to
       grow as an individual, but to build relationships with everyone I meet on my way up,
       because I know I will meet them on my way down. I have been behind the computer since
       I was 7 years old, and have been inseparable from it since. My passion stems from
       gaming, informative reading, and networking on platforms like Discord and Teamspeak.</p>

        </ul>
        <!-- Here I am using <ul> unordered lists, to create bullet points and show organization in the webpage, each declaration of <ul> should have <li> list items included then closed by </ul>-->
