# ZacksPortfolio
My personal portfolio website!

This Website provides a glimpse into some of the things I have been learning at Thinkful.
I needed this website to showcase skills, and who doesn't want to have their own website!

Looking back on this Project from early June I am now in my second month as a Software Dev at Thinkful. We have learned so much about different FORMS, STATE, and things to work on in the Front-End. My styling and use of BOOTSTRAP aswell as creating a single CSS file, by building and uploading with VERCEL, we could really come back and define a brand as well as incorporate myself with on a multi use platform such as the internet.

I am excited to start re-visiting this project and styling things, as well as accessing STATE, incorporating REACT and ROUTING, implementing new HTML FORMS and growing my personal portfolio!
